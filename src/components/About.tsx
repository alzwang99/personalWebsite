            <h2> Front-end Dev, UX Designer, Business</h2>
            <p><br />I like to build the worst ideas with the best execution.</p>
            <p><br /><br />An architecture professor once told me that you can complete a project to do the bare minimal, but to finish a project, you must put in effort, innovation, and fiery passion to showcase its greatness.</p>
            <p><br />What I want to achieve is creating a comfortable and holistic experience for consumers when using an unfamiliar product. I want to construct software that connects design, business, and engineering, allowing clear-cut communication and cooperation.</p>
            <p><br />In my free time, I want to focus on stuff outside of the computer, creating things with my hands and connecting with the outside world.</p>
