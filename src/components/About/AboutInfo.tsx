<h2> Front-end Dev, UX Designer, Business Thinker</h2>
<p><br />I like to build the worst ideas with the best execution.</p>
<p><br /><br />An architecture professor once told me that you can complete a project to do the bare minimal, but to finish a project, you must put in effort, innovation, and fiery passion to showcase its greatness.</p>
<p><br />What I want to achieve is developing a comfortable and holistic experience for consumers when using an unfamiliar product. I want to construct software that connects design, business, and engineering, allowing clear-cut communication and cooperation.</p>
<p><br />In my free time, I try to avoid spending time on my computer, creating things with my hands, such as sewing, crocheting, or building foam-core models, and connecting with the natural world.</p>
